 ***** The core of TECO *****  

NOTE - A number of common TECO commands follow this general pattern -  
 nX string ESC  

 We need to implement the following types of commands - 
a) File commands - 
       - ERfname$  - open file "fname" for read access 
       - EBfname$  - open file for read/write with backup 
       - EWfname$  - open file for writing.   
       - EX$$ - close output file and exit.   

b) The eight basic Teco functions 
       - DOT (current value of POINT)
       - nC - Move POINT \T{n} characters forward. 
       - nD - Delete \T{n} characters. 
       - Istring\A{ESC} - Insert text. 
       - nJ - Move POINT to absolute position \T{n} 
       - m,nK - Kill a range of characters. 
       - Sstring\A{ESC} - Search for a string. 
       - Z - Current buffer size.  
c) Line-oriented commands - 
       - nL - Move to beginning of $\T{n}^{th}$ line from \POINT{}. 
       - nK - Kill from point  to beginning of $\T{n}^{th}$ following
              line. 
d) Looping -  
       - n< - Begin \T{n}-iteration loop. 
       - >  - End loop. 
       - n; - Exit loop if $\T{n} \geq 0$.  
e) Conditionals -  
       - n"x - ( To be completed..... )      
f) "Q-registers", to store results. 
g) Conversion functions, from numbers to strings and vice versa.  
    
Helper functions 
   Move n characters left or right from current position 
   Use f.seek(n, 1) where 1 denotes "measure from current position"
