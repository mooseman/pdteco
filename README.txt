This is a public-domain Python implementation of the core functionality 
of the wonderful old TECO editor.  It is possible that a C version may also 
be done.  

The aim is to implement the core functionality of TECO. This includes 
moving within lines and around a file, and searching for, inserting, replacing 
and deleting text.  

TECO (in its various implementations) was (and is) an **extremely powerful** 
tool for the editing of text.  It was, in fact, the predecessor of the famous Emacs
editor.   

This implementation is likely to be but the palest shadow of the original. 
Nevertheless, it should be fun to do, and hopefully fun to use. 
Who knows, it may even (one day) be useful.....  :)  

pdteco is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy......"  ;)
