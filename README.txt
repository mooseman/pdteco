#  Acknowledgement - Very many thanks to the developers of the 
#  public-domain "eel" implementation of TECO, available here - 
#  http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/teco/eel/
#  This Python implementation would have been much more difficult if that 
#  version had not been available. 

This is a public-domain Python implementation of the core functionality 
of the wonderful old TECO editor.  

TECO (in its various implementations) was (and is) an **extremely powerful** 
tool for the editing of text.  It was, in fact, the predecessor of the famous Emacs
editor.   

This implementation is likely to be but the palest shadow of the original. 
Nevertheless, it should be fun to do, and hopefully fun to use. 
Who knows, it may even (one day) be useful.....  :)  

pdteco is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy......"  ;)
